	Click the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository."

**2)Initialize a Git Repository in Your Project Directory:
	Open a command prompt or terminal window.
	Navigate to your project directory using the cd command.
	Run the following commands to initialize a Git repository and configure your username and email:	
		git init
		git config --global user.name "Md Khorshed Alam"
		git config --global user.email "alam689@gmail.com"
**3)Add and Commit Your Project Files:
	Use the following commands to add your project files and make an initial commit:
		git add .
		git commit -m "Initial commit"
**4)Link Your Local Repository to the New GitHub Repository:
	Go to your GitHub repository's page and copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
	Run the following command to add a remote connection to your local repository:
	If using HTTPS:
		git remote add origin https://github.com/alam689/PCML_SALES_APP.git
If using SSH:
		git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-new-repo.git
**5)Push Your Local Repository to GitHub:
	Use the following command to push your project files to the new GitHub repository:
		git push -u origin master
	This command will push your local project to the "master" branch of the new repository on GitHub. If you have a different main branch, replace "master" with your branch name.

**6)Authenticate with the New GitHub Account:
	If you are prompted to enter your GitHub credentials, provide the username and password for the new GitHub account.
**7)Verify Your Files on GitHub:
	Visit the new GitHub repository in your web browser to ensure that your project files have been successfully uploaded.
	
	Your project directory is now uploaded to the new GitHub account. You can continue to work on your project and make further commits as needed.
